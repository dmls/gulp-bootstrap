# Frontend Assets

### Installation
Clone repo or download zip and place contents into project directory, adjusting paths as needed in `gulpfile.js`. 

`package.json` needs to go in the project root directory. 
`gulpfile.js` and `assets` directory can go in a subdirectory together or stay in the site root. 

### Use
Run `gulp` from the CLI.
